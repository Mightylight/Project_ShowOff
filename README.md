# Escape the Gator

Escape the Gator is a local player versus player racing survival game.
Player one, the vicious alligator, has to protect his territory from the pesky canoe driver.
Player two, the canoe driver, has to get his way out of the swamp, before the alligator destroys his boat and eats him alive!
A fun and immersive experience, giving you the adrenaline kick, while also impressing with its beautiful environment.


This project was made by Team Bas n'Cas, consisting of:
Bas Meddeler, Cas Weerkamp, Senne Oogink, Chris Peters, Ruslans Aleksejevs, Alex WÃ³jtowicz and Julian Riel.

This game was made for a module at the University of applied Sience Saxion and the specific client this game was made for is the overkill festival.
The game was also nominated, as a jury of professionals selected this to be the most fitting project out of 11 incredible installations, to be at the overkill festival in November 2023

## The Game
Both players have a different objective. The person in the boat, using a VR headset, has to row as far as they can while making sure the alligator tries to break the boat.
While the alligator, using a controller, is trying to break the boat, the person in the boat is able to slap the alligator away using the paddles.

In the boat, the person is able to physically row to advanced forward, making it a really realistic experience. By rowing past the obstacles, the player will
find themselve in an ever-changing world that slowly turn everything digital. Vines become Cables, trees change colour and much more!
